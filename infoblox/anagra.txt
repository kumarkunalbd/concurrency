Anagram is a word, phrase, or sentence formed from another by rearranging its letters. Given 2 strings s and t. Find out the number of anagrams of t in s.
example: s = "xyzabyzxsayxzyerfxyasz", t = "xyz" res = 4 (Xyz {0,2}, yzx {5,7}, yxz {10, 12}, xzy {11,13})

"xyzabyzxsayxzyerfxyasz"
l =0
r = 2

l:=1 r=2-Len(t)
xyz x,y,z
yza != xyz
